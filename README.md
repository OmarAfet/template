## About This Project
A simple web development starter template using React 19, Next.js 15, TailwindCSS, and Shadcn UI. I created this for my personal projects, but it's published for anyone who wants to use it.

Everything is pre-configured so you can focus on building features rather than setting up the technical foundation.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OmarAfet/template.git .
git remote rm origin
bun install
bun dev
```
