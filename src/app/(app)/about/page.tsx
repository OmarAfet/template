                A simple web development starter template using React 19, Next.js 15, TailwindCSS, and Shadcn UI. I created this for my personal projects, but it&apos;s published for anyone who wants to use it.

                Everything is pre-configured so you can focus on building features rather than setting up the technical foundation.
